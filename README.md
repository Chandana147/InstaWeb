1. Working Prototype:
A working Angular-based drag-and-drop website builder that allows users to:

Drag UI elements (text, image, button, etc.)

Drop them into a layout area

Adjust their properties via a form panel

Export the final structure for deployment or saving

üìù 2. Brief Documentation
üìå Project Overview
This project is a drag-and-drop website builder built with Angular. The purpose is to transform a traditional form-based UI into an intuitive drag-and-drop interface,
allowing users to visually design a web layout and configure each component's properties (like text, image source, size, etc.).

üß∞ Tools and Packages Used
Tool/Package	Purpose
Angular 16+	Frontend framework
@angular/cdk/drag-drop	Provides drag-and-drop functionality
angular-cli-ghpages	For deploying the Angular app to GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages	Hosting the deployed site
Git	Version control and deployment
VS Code	Code editor
Node.js + npm	JS runtime and package management

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality
üîπ Drag-and-Drop
Implemented using @angular/cdk/drag-drop

Allows users to drag UI elements (like text, image, button) into the builder canvas

Each dropped element is dynamically rendered and can be selected

üîπ Property Editor Panel
When an element is selected, a property panel opens

Users can customize text content, image URLs, font size, colors, etc.

Changes reflect immediately in the UI

üîπ Exporting
The app structure is saved in a structured format (likely as a JSON or HTML-like export)

Prepares for either saving, deploying, or converting to actual HTML templates

üí° Rationale Behind the Approach
Requirement	              Approach & Why
Visual builder	          Used Angular + CDK drag-drop for responsive UI handling
Customization panel	      Property binding with Angular makes real-time updates simple and clean
Deployment	              Used GitHub Pages for free, static hosting with simple angular-cli-ghpages
Version control	          Git + GitHub ensures easy collaboration and tracking
